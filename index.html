  <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
  <p><em>Last updated: 20 Aug 2025</em></p>

  <p>Krystian Żabicki built the FuelUp app as an ad-supported app with optional Premium subscription. This SERVICE is provided by Krystian Żabicki and is intended for use as is.</p>

  <p>This page explains our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use the Service.</p>

  <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We use personal information only to provide and improve the Service and do not share it except as described here.</p>

  <p><strong>Terms used</strong> in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms &amp; Conditions unless otherwise defined here.</p>

  <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
  <p>To provide features like login, sync, analytics, ads (free version) and subscriptions, we may process the following categories of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account &amp; Authentication (optional)</strong>: If you sign in with Apple, Google, or Facebook, we receive your unique user ID and, where you permit, your name, email address and profile photo. We store your user ID (and email, if provided) in Firebase to keep your data in sync across devices.</li>
    <li><strong>App Data you add</strong>: Preferences and in-app content you save (e.g., settings, saved items) are stored in <em>Firebase Realtime Database</em> to power app functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases &amp; Subscriptions</strong>: Payments are processed by Apple In-App Purchases. We do <em>not</em> receive or store your card/billing numbers. We only receive anonymous receipt/entitlement info to unlock Premium (managed via Apple and, where applicable, RevenueCat).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage &amp; Diagnostics</strong>: We use Firebase Analytics to understand feature usage and Firebase Crashlytics to improve stability (e.g., device model, OS version, crash stack traces, anonymized IDs).</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising (free version)</strong>: We use Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and ad performance signals for ad delivery/fraud prevention. Buying Premium removes ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <div>
    <p>The app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Their privacy policies:</p>

  <p><strong>Social Logins</strong></p>
  <p>If you choose to log in with Apple, Google, or Facebook, the respective provider may share certain profile data as described above. We use it solely to authenticate you and operate your account/session. You can revoke access in your provider’s account settings.</p>

  <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
  <p>In case of errors in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your device called Log Data. This may include device IP address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, the time and date of your use, and crash diagnostics.</p>

  <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
  <p>The Service does not use cookies explicitly. However, third-party code and libraries (e.g., AdMob, Firebase) may use similar identifiers to collect information and improve their services. On iOS you can control app tracking and advertising settings in <em>Settings &rarr; Privacy &amp; Security</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
  <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to: facilitate the Service, provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties are obligated not to disclose or use information for any other purpose.</p>

  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
  <p>We value your trust in providing us your information and strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
  <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or higher age as required by your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that a child has provided us with personal information, we delete it.</p>

  <p><strong>Data Retention &amp; Your Choices</strong></p>
  <p>We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes above, then delete or aggregate it. You may request deletion of your account-linked data by emailing <a href="mailto:fueluphelp@gmail.com">fueluphelp@gmail.com</a>. You can also turn off personalized ads and tracking in your device settings; purchasing Premium removes ads.</p>

  <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page and update the “Last updated” date above.</p>

  <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
  <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:fueluphelp@gmail.com">fueluphelp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Voice Logging (Microphone & Speech Recognition)</strong></p>
  <p>The app offers an optional voice logging feature that allows users to add fuel entries using spoken commands.</p>

  <p>If you choose to use this feature:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The app will request access to your device’s microphone solely to record your voice input.</li>
    <li>Your spoken input may be processed using speech recognition technology to convert it into text and automatically fill in fuel log data (such as fuel amount, unit price, total cost, and mileage).</li>
    <li>Voice data may be transmitted to third-party processing services strictly for the purpose of speech-to-text conversion and AI-based data interpretation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Voice recordings are not stored by the app after processing unless explicitly required for technical reasons. The microphone is only used while the voice logging feature is actively enabled by the user.</p>
