<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: 20 Aug 2025</small></p>

<p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the FuelUp mobile application (“App”) provided by Krystian Żabicki (“we”, “us”, “our”). By downloading or using the App you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1) License &amp; Ownership</h2>
<p>We grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on devices you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use. You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative works of, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the App. All rights, title, and interest in and to the App (including content and trademarks) are owned by us or our licensors.</p>

<h2>2) Account &amp; Social Logins</h2>
<p>To access certain features you may need an account or use social logins (Apple, Google, Facebook). When using a social login, we receive a unique identifier and, if permitted, your name and email to create/authenticate your account. You must keep your credentials secure and promptly update inaccurate information. Your use of social logins is also subject to the third-party provider’s terms and policies.</p>

<h2>3) Subscriptions &amp; In-App Purchases</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Auto-renewing subscriptions.</strong> FuelUp offers optional paid subscriptions (“Premium”). Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each period and will be charged to the payment method linked to your Apple ID.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage &amp; cancel.</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in <em>Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; Subscriptions</em> on your device. To avoid renewal, cancel at least 24 hours before the current period ends.</li>
  <li><strong>Trials.</strong> If offered, free trials convert to a paid subscription unless canceled before the trial ends. Unused portions of a trial may be forfeited when you purchase.</li>
  <li><strong>Billing &amp; refunds.</strong> Charges are processed by Apple. We do not store card details. Refunds are handled by Apple per their policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Entitlements.</strong> We may use RevenueCat to validate purchases and manage entitlements. This does not change your relationship with Apple as the seller of digital content.</li>
  <li><strong>Ads.</strong> The free version may display ads (e.g., via AdMob). Premium removes in-app ads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4) Data, Connectivity &amp; Safety</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Connectivity.</strong> Some functions require an active internet connection (Wi-Fi or cellular). Data charges from your carrier may apply, including roaming.</li>
  <li><strong>Your device.</strong> You are responsible for keeping your device secure, charged, and up to date. Do not use the App on jailbroken/rooted devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety.</strong> Do not interact with the App while driving or where doing so could create a safety risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App integrates third-party services that have their own terms and privacy policies. Your use of those services is subject to their terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AdMob — <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms</a></li>
  <li>Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics, Realtime Database) — <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms</a></li>
  <li>RevenueCat (subscriptions) — <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms</a></li>
  <li>Apple Media Services — <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms</a></li>
  <li>Google — <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms</a></li>
  <li>Meta/Facebook — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>6) Maintenance, Changes &amp; Availability</h2>
<p>We may update, change, or discontinue the App (or any feature) at any time. You agree to install updates we provide. We aim to keep the App available and accurate but make no promise it will always be uninterrupted, timely, or error-free.</p>

<h2>7) Apple App Store Terms (iOS EULA Notice)</h2>
<p>These Terms are between you and us, not Apple. We, not Apple, are solely responsible for the App and its content, maintenance and support, and handling any claims. Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you. If the App fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any). To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the App.</p>

<h2>8) Acceptable Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not misuse the App, interfere with its operation, attempt unauthorized access, or upload harmful code.</li>
  <li>Use the App only as permitted by law and these Terms. We may suspend or terminate access for violations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
<p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, secure, or that defects will be corrected.</p>

<h2>10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, use, or goodwill, arising from or related to your use of the App. Our aggregate liability for all claims shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you paid to us for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim, or (b) USD 20. Nothing in these Terms limits liability for fraud, willful misconduct, or injury where such limitation is prohibited by law.</p>

<h2>11) Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if you breach these Terms or if we discontinue the App. Upon termination, the rights granted to you under these Terms will end and you must stop using and delete the App.</p>

<h2>12) Privacy</h2>
<p>Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect and process personal data (including via Firebase, AdMob, and RevenueCat). The Privacy Policy is available in the app (Settings → Privacy) and in the App Store listing.</p>

<h2>13) Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Poland, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Mandatory consumer protection rights under your local law remain unaffected. Courts of Warsaw, Poland shall have jurisdiction, unless mandatory law provides otherwise.</p>

<h2>14) Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., in-app or on our site). Changes apply from the “Last updated” date above. Your continued use of the App means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>15) Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact: <a href="mailto:fueluphelp@gmail.com">fueluphelp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
